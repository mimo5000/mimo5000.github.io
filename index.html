  The Morrison Preparatory School was founded in 2011 as an inclusive education centre,
  <br>providing learning opportunities for children with a wide range of physical and mental
  <br>abilities in the rural village of Kindu, Kenya.  Due to the remote location of the village,
  <br>access to schooling had been limited for many children – particularly those with mobility challenges.
  <br>
  <br>The school started as two small rooms and 40 students, and has since grown to seven classrooms and
  <br>over 100 students!  The school is locally operated and funded in large part through private <a href="\donate.html">donations</a>.</p></h4>
