<p>The Morrison Preparatory School was founded in 2011 as an inclusive education centre, providing learning opportunities for children with a wide range of physical and mental abilities in the rural village of Kindu, Kenya.  Due to the remote location of the village, access to schooling had been limited for many children – particularly those with mobility challenges. The school started as two small rooms and 40 students, and has since grown to seven classrooms and over 100 students! The school is locally operated, and funded in large part through private <a href="\donate.html">donations</a>.</p>
