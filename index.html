<p align="center">The Morrison Preparatory School was founded in 2011 as an inclusive education centre, providing learning opportunities <br>for children with a wide range of physical and mental abilities in the rural village of Kindu, Kenya.  <br>Due to the remote location of the village, access to schooling had been limited for many children – particularly those with mobility challenges. <br>The school started as two small rooms and 40 students, and has since grown to seven classrooms and over 100 students! <br>The school is locally operated, and funded in large part through private <a href="\donate.html">donations</a>.</p>
